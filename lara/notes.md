# Misc. notes about various things, mostly stream-of-consciousness thoughts and the like

- "Reward" language vs "natural" language
    - Natural language allows for better intepretability and human interaction
    - Can "reward" language be as expressive though? => Reward hypothesis!

- Does an agent need a model of the world, or is a model of itself sufficient?
    - But, if it only has a model of itself, how can it act in the world?
