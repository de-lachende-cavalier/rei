I use this repo to store various experiments related to Reinforcement Learning, mostly in the PoC stage (i.e., what I mean by pre-alpha/alpha in the short description).

It is, then, an idea foundry, of sorts, to which all contributions are not only welcomed, but highly encouraged!
If you see something that piques your interest, feel free to send a pull request.
